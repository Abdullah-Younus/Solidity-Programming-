# Solidity-Programming
Write production-ready smart contracts for Ethereum blockchain with Solidity
Solidity is contract-oriented programming language used for writing decentralized applications on Ethereum.
  1) Test and debug smart contracts with Truffle, Ganache, Remix, and MetaMask
  2) Gain insights into maintaining code quality with different tools
  3) Get up to speed with ERC standards such as ERC-20 and ERC-721
  4) Become adept at using design patterns while writing smart contracts
  5) Use MultiSignature (MultiSig) wallets and improve the security of contracts
  6) Use Oracle services to fetch information from outside the blockchain
